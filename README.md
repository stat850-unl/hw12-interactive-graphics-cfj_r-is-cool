# Animated and Interactive Graphics

## Instructions

Use the [TidyTuesday Cocktail Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/readme.md) to create a shiny applet containing the following:

- A visual exploration of the cocktail data
- A way for a user to search through cocktail recipes by ingredient

Your applet should make use of reactivity in both components, but the specifics of what you do and how you do it are up to you.

Once you're satisfied with your applet, upload it to [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). You should be able to use the free hosting - you're not creating any high-traffic applications yet. 

You can find the instructions for deploying your application [here](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#working-with-shiny-for-r).

When you've deployed your application, edit this README to contain a link to your applet.

Here is the link to my applet:

The applet is an  interactive database to choose your own ingredients, the glass type and the measurement of the ingredient that you want.These options are tied to each other in a such a way that the choice of glass is dependent on the ingredient chosen, and the measurement also depends on the previous selection on ingredient and glass. One cool thing is, you're able also able view the image of the cocktail that you have made by clicking on the 
link below the drink_thumb column.
